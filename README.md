### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- how to add universal box-sizing

```html
*, *:before, *:after { box-sizing: inherit; } html { box-sizing: border-box; }
```

- how to make body 100% in height

```html
html { height: 100%; } body { min-height: 100%; margin: 0; }
```

### Useful resources

- [box-sizing](https://css-tricks.com/box-sizing/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand box-sizing. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
